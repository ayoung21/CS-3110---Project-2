# CS 3110 - Project 2

## Overview
The Commodore 64 has built-in support for sprites. A sprite is an object that can move around on the screen, like a mouse pointer or a player character in a 2D game. Because of limitations in graphics hardware, many systems of the time, like the C64 and the NES, implemented hardware-level support for sprites. In the C64's case, it has support for up to eight sprites at one time. These can be displayed in a single-color high resolution mode, or a 3-color low-resolution mode. Each sprite can be turned on or off independently, and each can be moved independently in the (x,y) directions on the screen.

In this project you will make the C64 display all eight sprites, each a different color, and each in a different position. I will give you the data for the pixels (which make an ant picture).
